# CS252-OS-Assignment-Monte-Carlo-Sim
 Assignment for CS 252 course. Using Multithreaded Programming for finding pi using Monte Carlo Simulation technique
<br/> One of the solutions to the problem statements **4.24** and **7.17** in **10th** edition of Operating System Concepts by ABRAHAM SILBERSCHATZ, PETER BAER GALVIN, GREG GAGNE
#### Inspiration for the code is taken from Andew Dotson's YouTube video for calculating Ï€ i.e<br/> ***How to Estimate Pi Numerically in Python***    (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjfrNc-G-zA&ab_channel=AndrewDotson)
